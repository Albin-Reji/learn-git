        Web design refers to the design, creation, and maintenance of websites.
        The terms web design and web development are often used interchangeably,
        however, web design typically refers to the front-end (client side) of a
        website, which includes its appearance, layout, and content. Web design
        involves a range of tasks, including graphic design, user interface (UI)
        design, user experience (UX) design, and search engine optimization.
        Successful Web Designers typically have a strong understanding of HTML,
        CSS, and JAVA, as well as UX design and UI design principles.
